                        <p>My name is Ahmed, I am born and raised in my home town; Aleppo, Syria. I have 6 year old twin girls and a two year baby boy. I have lost my wife while giving birth to my two year old son. I miss my wife, but I am blessed to have my children. My children are beautiful, they inspire, they are the reason of my existence.</p>
<p>I worked as an Arabic teacher during my days in Syria, I used to go to work everyday with a passion of teaching, giving students the knowledge of the beautiful Arabic language. But, schools were shut, war has gone worse. we would hear soldiers attacking our neighbors, bombing attacks and gun shots almost twice a day. My kids lived in fear. I lived in fear.</p>
<p>Food supply has gone short, there are days where we couldn't find food at all, due to the shortage and high demand. By selling my valuables, including my watch my wife brought me for our anniversary. I would manage to settle a deal to get a piece of bread, and ask my children to share it so they wouldn't starve to death. They would share that one piece for an average of 3 days. Me? I would only have a bite of it for the sake of staying alive for my kids.</p>
<p>The blood around the street is increasing every time I would look at the window. Having dead bodies isn't a view I wanted my kids to wake up and sleep in front of every morning. Therefore, I had to run away from my beloved town. My home.</p>
<p>I had to join the group that are planning to go to Europe by a boat, I had to save my children. I had to give them hope to life. We went on the boat, my kids were terrified, but excited. One of my little twins said "Finally Baba, we will soon sleep without hearing gun shots, I wonder how that feels?, we have never had a quiet night while growing up." after hearing those words from Yasmin, I knew I have made the right decision. We were on our way to Europe. And as we were getting closer, an error has accrued to the boat and it started sinking. What do I do? one man with three kids. I had to carry my two year old son, and help my 6 year old girls, as I already taught them how to swim. As we were swimming for our lives. It got harder, the waves got stronger. My Daughters went further away from me, I tried to hold on to them but the waves wouldn't let me. I tried my best to hold on to themâ€¦ I lost them.</p>  
<p>I am now with Mohammed my two year old son in Greece, trying to recover from our tragic losses.</p>
<p>I do tutor, and translate Arabic material. Please do let me know if you need my service.</p>
